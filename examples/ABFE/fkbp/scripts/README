This is a workflow to set up and run Absolute Binding Free energy calculations with protein-ligand systems

Requires the following directories:
ligands : containing ligand molecules in .mol2 format
receptor : containing a pdb file of the receptor
scripts : all necessary scripts to run the workflow

For setup,

First : edit the setup-setting-ABFE.sh file, chaning the name of the receptor, ligands etc.

Then from outside the scripts directory, run the "setup-atm-ABFE.sh" script

The workflow will create the "complexes" direcroty with each protein-ligand complex in its own sub-directory


More details and a tutorial will be provided soon...
