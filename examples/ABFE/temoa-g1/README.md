Absolute Binding Free Energy Between The TEMOA host and the G1 guest
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we will calculate the binding free energy of the TEMOA-G1 complex from the [SAMPL8 GDCC](https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/host_guest/GDCC) challenge using Alchemical Hamiltonian Replica Exchange with the [Alchemical Transfer Method](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00266) using [ASyncRE-OpenMM](https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/async_re-openmm) and the [ATMMetaForce OpenMM plugin](https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/openmm-atmmetaforce-plugin). See the previous [README](https://github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/async_re-openmm/examples/README.md) for additional specific software requirements.
